# is-bio website installation

This article is about how to install *is-bio* website on **CentOS 10 SELinux** (security-enhanced Linux).

## Apply for a domain name and add DNS A records

### Decide which server to install *is-bio* on

If you have limited budget and already have an underutilized server, you can install *is-bio* on that server.

**Port 80 can be shared by multiple websites without conflicts.**

The following assumes that your domain name is *your-domain.com*. If you don't have a domain, you can just use `the_server_ip`.

### Create DNS A records

1. Record 1
    - Record type: A
    - Name: @
    - IPv4 address: the_server_ip

2. Record 2 (optional)
    - Record type: A
    - Name: www
    - IPv4 address: the_server_ip

## Login to server via SSH

```shell
ssh root@the_server_ip
sudo passwd root # change password
```

## Install Ruby

```shell
yum install ruby
dnf install -y git
exit
```

## Install packages

```shell
yum install ruby-devel # Solve `bigdecimal` with native extensions issue

# Solve `psych` with native extensions failed issue.
curl -O https://rpmfind.net/linux/centos-stream/10-stream/CRB/x86_64/os/Packages/libyaml-devel-0.2.5-16.el10.x86_64.rpm
rpm -Uvh libyaml-devel-0.2.5-16.el10.x86_64.rpm
yum info libyaml-devel
```

## Clone project and install Ruby gems

```shell
cd /srv
git clone https://github.com/is-bio/is-bio.git
cd /srv/is-bio
bundle install
```

## Set environment variables

```shell
# Set envs
echo 'export RAILS_ENV="production"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
exit

# Then use "ssh" to log in to the server again
echo $RAILS_ENV # check whether the environment variables have taken effect
```

## Set credentials

```shell
cd /srv/is-bio

# This file contains all the credentials that need to be set.
cat config/credentials.yml.example # Set "all" of them with the next command:

# After saving it, "config/credentials.yml.enc" and "config/master.key" will be created.
# In order for the modified credentials to take effect, you need to restart the Rails web server.
EDITOR="vim" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

**All** items shown in `config/credentials.yml.example` need to be set!

If you are still not sure how to set some items, you can use the default values in `config/credentials.yml.example` first, and then set the values correctly according to the relevant instructions when you find that the relevant functions do not work.

## Prepare SQLite database

```shell
cd /srv/is-bio
rails db:migrate # The database file is `./storage/development.sqlite3`. Running it has no side effects.
rails db:seed # Running it has no side effects.
```

## Install theme

Please follow [docs/install_theme.md](/docs/install_theme.md) to install it.

## Start or restart Rails web server

```shell
cd /srv/is-bio
rails assets:precompile # This needs to be executed whenever any assets are changed. Running it has no side effects.
pkill -F /var/run/blog.pid # Stop Rails web server. If you haven't started the Rails web server yet, you don't need to run it.
bundle exec puma -w 1 -e production # This is used to test if Rails web server can run well.
ctrl + c # If it has no error, press `ctrl + c` to terminate it. Then run:
# Start Rails web server, the `-w` parameter value here needs to be the same as the number of CPU cores of the server to maximize the web load. You can use `lscpu` to view it.
nohup bundle exec puma -w 1 -e production -b unix:///var/run/blog.sock --pidfile /var/run/blog.pid & 
tail -n 200 nohup.out # ./nohup.out is the log file
exit # When the ssh session is closed, the processes started during the session will also be terminated. So you should run `exit` in time to avoid the started processes being terminated.
```

## Firewall

```shell
firewall-cmd --state
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services

# This step is critical.  
firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp
firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Configure Nginx

```shell
sudo su
dnf install -y nginx

# For `SELinux` only. To solve the problem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23948527/13-permission-denied-while-connecting-to-upstreamnginx
# If you restarted the server, you have to run this two lines again!
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
sudo setenforce 0

cd /etc/nginx
cp /srv/is-bio/docs/deploy/nginx.conf ./ # Replace the existing file
cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
cp /srv/is-bio/docs/deploy/default_server.conf ./
cp /srv/is-bio/docs/deploy/blog_nginx.conf ./
vim blog_nginx.conf # Replace the "your-domain.com" with your actual domain name.

nginx -t # Check whether the configuration is correct.
systemctl enable nginx # Set to start automatically at boot
systemctl start nginx # "systemctl start nginx" is also ok
```

Visit http://your-domain.com, you should see that the web works well.

## Troubleshooting

1. Always make sure that the Rails web server is running!

    ```shell
    ps -ef|grep puma # You should see the process running. If you didn't see any process listed, you should start Rails web server.
    bundle exec puma -w 1 -e production # This is used to test if Rails web server can run well. If it has no error, then `ctrl + c` to terminate it. Then run:
    # Start Rails web server.
    nohup bundle exec puma -w 1 -e production -b unix:///var/run/blog.sock --pidfile /var/run/blog.pid &
    tail -n 200 nohup.out # ./nohup.out is the log file
    exit # When the ssh session (connection) is closed, the processes started during the session will also be terminated. So you should run `exit` in time to avoid the started processes being terminated.
    ```

2. Always make sure that nginx is running!

    ```shell
    ps -ef|grep nginx # You should see the process running. If you didn't see any process listed, you should start nginx.
    nginx -t # Check whether the configuration is correct.
    systemctl reload nginx.service # Reload nginx with no downtime.
    systemctl restart nginx # Make sure there is no error. If there is an error, fix it by reading the error message.
    exit # When the ssh session (connection) is closed, the processes started during the session will also be terminated. So you should run `exit` in time to avoid the started processes being terminated.
    ```

    - Check nginx errors by:

        ```shell
        tail -n 200 /var/log/nginx/error.log
        > /var/log/nginx/error.log # clear it
        
        cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied
        > /var/log/audit/audit.log # clear it
        ```

3. If the status code of `assets` (js, css, images, etc.) is *404*.
    - **Clear your browser cache** and refresh the page again.

### If you have restarted the server machine

These steps need to be done again.

```shell
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
sudo setenforce 0
systemctl restart nginx
```

## Create the Admin User

```shell
cd /srv/is-bio
vim db/seeds.rb
```

Uncomment the first few lines of code to create the Admin User.

```shell
rails db:seed
git restore db/seeds.rb
```

Use this email address and password to log in on http://your-domain.com/admin.

## Send email via SMTP

Please follow the instructions in [docs/send_email_via_smtp_guide.md](/docs/send_email_via_smtp_guide.md) to complete this step.

## Start "Solid Queue" to handle background jobs

Blog posts, images, files synchronization, sending emails, generating thumbnails, etc. all require background tasks to be started!

```shell
cd /srv/is-bio
# If there is content output on the screen, it means that some asset files has been rewritten.
#   You need to restart Rails web server for the changes to take effect.
rails assets:precompile

bin/jobs # This is used to test if background tasks can run well.
ctrl + c # If it has no error, press `ctrl + c` to terminate it. Then run:
nohup bin/jobs & # Start it. "/nohup.out" is the log file
exit # When the ssh session is closed, the processes started during the session will also be terminated. So you should run `exit` in time to avoid the started processes being terminated.
```

- First, use email address and password to log in on http://your-domain.com/admin.
- Second, use this username and password to log in on http://your-domain.com/jobs to see if there are failed tasks.
    - The username and password can be obtained by running `EDITOR="vim" bin/rails credentials:edit`.

### Restart "Solid Queue" to handle background jobs

When the code related to the background task is changed, you need to restart "Solid Queue" for the changes to take effect.

```shell
ps -ef|grep solid
kill -9 the_solid-queue-supervisor_pid
ps -ef|grep solid # Verify that there are no related processes listed.
nohup bin/jobs & # Start it. "/nohup.out" is the log file.
ps -ef|grep solid # Confirm that it is started.
exit # When the ssh session is closed, the processes started during the session will also be terminated. So you should run `exit` in time to avoid the started processes being terminated.
```

### Money-saving plan

Because running "Solid Queue" will start several Linux processes, it will consume some memory.
If you don't run these processes normally, and only execute them manually when you want to update your blog or send emails to users:

```shell
cd /srv/is-bio
bin/jobs # After the execution is completed, `ctrl + c` to close the process
```

This can save some memory consumption (I measured that it saved about 200M), but it sacrifices some convenience.
To see how much memory can be saved, you can use `top` to view it, mainly focusing on `MiB Mem: the_number free`.

### Troubleshooting

Important source code may have been modified, causing problems with background task processing. **Restart** `Solid Queue` and see.

```shell
# You should see the process running. If you didn't see any process listed,
#   you should start it by reading the instructions above.
ps -ef|grep solid
```

## Create and install your "GitHub App" to sync "markdown-blog" repository's files' changes to your blog website

Please read [markdown-blog](https://github.com/is-bio/markdown-blog) if you are not familiar with how to write a blog using Markdown and Git.

Please follow the instructions in [GitHub_App.md](/docs/GitHub_App.md) to complete this step.

## Automatically generate thumbnails for images

We use [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to generate thumbnails for images.

```shell
cd /usr/local/sbin
curl -O https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/magick
chmod 755 magick
exit 

magick -version # To test if it has been installed successfully.
```

## Support "https" (TLS/SSL) for web

It is recommended that you enable https because the canonical url of the pages start with "https://".

### Way 1: Use a third-party service such as CloudFlare. Large domain name service providers generally provide this service for free (Recommended)

This is the most convenient way.

If you use CloudFlare SSL/TLS encryption default mode `Flexible`, you can see "https" has already been supported.

The ".dev" domain is a bit special because it requires the use of TLS. If you use CloudFlare's service, one solution is: `<your-domain>.dev -> SSL/TLS -> Edge Certificates -> Enable "Always Use HTTPS"`.

You can visit https://your-domain.com to check it.

### Way 2: Implement support for "https" (TLS/SSL) yourself

Please read [enable_https](/docs/deploy/enable_https.md).

## Redirections

In CloudFlare dashboard, click `Rules`.

### Redirect http:// to https://

- `Rule templates` > Choose template `Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS` > `Create a Rule`.
- Don't need to change anything, just click `Deploy`.

### Redirect www.your-domain.com to your-domain.com

- `Rule templates` > Choose template `Redirect from WWW to Root` > `Create a Rule`.
- Don't need to change anything, just click `Deploy`.

## Setting up your website

Read [setup_website.md](/docs/setup_website.md).

## How to upgrade the website to the latest version.

```shell
pkill -F /var/run/blog.pid # Stop Rails web server
# The next two lines are another way to stop Rails web server
#ps -ef | grep puma # You will get a pid which is the same as `cat /var/run/blog.pid`.
#kill -9 the_master_pid # Some workers processes are started by master process, you can kill the master pid.

cd /srv/is-bio
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash apply
bundle install
rails db:migrate # You can skip this step if no new migration files added. Running it has no side effects. 
rails db:seed # You can skip this step if `db/seeds.rb` is not changed. Running it has no side effects.
rails assets:precompile # This needs to be executed whenever any assets are changed.
```

- Then follow the `## Start or restart Rails web server` section to restart Rails web server.
- Follow the `### Restart "Solid Queue" to handle background jobs` section to restart "Solid Queue".

## Database backup

```shell
# Run it in your local computer
scp root@the_server_ip:/srv/is-bio/storage/production.sqlite3 ./
```
